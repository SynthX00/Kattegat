#Kattegat

Kattegat is a simple building game developed with Monogame as a final project for my 1st year of college.
Unfortunately I wasn't able to finish drawing all the assets for the game, so it's somewhat unfinished.

#Development

The entire game was developed by me using C# and the Monogame API.
All the visual assets and sprites where drawn by me, unfortunately I wasn't able to make the sound effects, so those were made by others.

#Controls

The entire game is controlled by the keyboard (Arrow Keys and Space Bar).
